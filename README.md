In this project, we sought out to compare several different Machine Learning classifiers on the MNST Fashion Dataset. The goal was to tune each classifier hyper parameters so that they profrom the best they can on the dataset. 
In the end, we compared all of the classifiers we tuned and found which performed the best on this dataset. See the study below:
